# Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on medical and demographic data.  
It demonstrates a **complete machine learning workflow** â€“ from cleaning data to training and comparing models.

## Project Summary
1. Cleaned and prepared the dataset (fixed missing and invalid values)
2. Trained multiple machine learning models:
   - Logistic Regression (baseline + tuned)
   - Random Forest
   - SVM (Support Vector Machine)
   - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbours)
   - XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
3. Evaluated models using:
   - Accuracy (overall performance)
   - Sensitivity (how well we catch diabetic patients)
   - Specificity (how well we avoid false positives)
   - ROC Curves, AUC scores, and Confusion Matrix heatmaps
4. Used **cross-validation** to ensure the results are reliable.
